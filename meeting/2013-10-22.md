# Features
1. ratings (1st, previous 3)
2. weekday
3. facebook
4. google trend
5. sentiment (from facebook)

For time series features, to use *nowcasting* or *forecasting*?

# Feature Selection (Tiffany, Jerry)
If number of features is N, the possible number of combinations is 2^N.  
Need a comprehensive experiment on feature selection (automate it).

Two directions:

1. leave one out
2. none --> add one

# Domain Adaptation (Martin)
1. think of a feature as a domain?
2. read nowcasting paper
3. Apply an existing domain adaptation to forecasting TV ratings

# Conference
The quality standard of KDD 2014 is too high for us.  
**Alternative**: ACL 2014, 1/10 submission deadline
