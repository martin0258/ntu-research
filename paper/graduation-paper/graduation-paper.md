# Predicting TVR using Regression Transfer

> Keywords: time series prediction/forecasting, transfer learning, regression, TV ratings prediction/forecasting

## Abstract
TVR prediction is an important industrial problem (why?).  
This problem has become increasingly complex (why?), but little attention has been paid to improving accuracy using new methods.  
The primary contribution of this paper is to first solve TVR prediction in regression transfer learning setting.  
Roughly speaking, we solve the problem as follows.  
First, we use windowing transformation to convert time series data into a set of cases suitable for regression task.  
Then, several boosting-based transfer learning algorithms are applied to regression task.  
Experiment results show promise comparing with other tranditional forecasting methods.
